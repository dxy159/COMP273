Description of the different black boxes:
Register_8b_locked
	8 bit register which has control buffers on both ends which lock data inside unless the register is on in which case the buffers are interlocked according to R/W mode

Register_8b_passthrough
	8 bit register which always writes it's contents onto the output pins

Register_8b_passin
	8bit register which always writes it's input to the register memory

Ram_16B
	16 Byte ram adressed through a 4 bit address

Add_Sub_8bits
	8bit version of the adder/substractor from the assignment

Overflow_dector
	Black box which detects overflows in the adder/substractor operations 

ALU
	Black box which takes in ALU op codes and does the appropriate operations

ADD3IF5
	Adder used in the BCD converter 

Register_4b
	4 bit pass through register used for the 7 segment displays

DPath_FETCH
	contains the logic to implement the fetch operation for the processor
